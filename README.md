## Hergetto stands for Together

This project was created during the lockdown.
Normally you could just go to a friends house and start watching videos together, but now you can't do that anymore.
So that's why hergetto was created!
Watch videos together from the comfort of your own room!

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Create a new file in the config folder called `ueberauth.secret.exs`, copy the contents of `ueberauth.secret.exs.example` into it, and fill in the information
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
