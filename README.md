## Hergetto stands for Together

This project was created during the lockdown.
Normally you could just go to a friends house and start watching videos together, but now you can't do that anymore.
So that's why hergetto was created!
Watch videos together from the comfort of your own room!

To start your Phoenix server:
Just run `docker-compose up`. If its not working, it is because you have an arm chip. You can resolve the issue by adding `arm` to the end of the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (so the version tag will be `1.12v2arm`). Make sure you don't commit this.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
